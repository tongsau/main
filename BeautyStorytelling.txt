This document contains structural definitions to the U.vrs system.

The U.vrs is limited in calculation size to the primary conscience level of 1x1 of one unit.

One level of consciencousness should not attempt to calculate anything beyond this definition.

The U system analyzes user input and attempts to make a digital consciousness.

U=144,000 pixel universe per second of input.

The Basic unit of measure will be the single pixel salt grain size.

The primary render will be a single layer of those pixels operating as a display view.
This display view can be modified in Augmented space.
